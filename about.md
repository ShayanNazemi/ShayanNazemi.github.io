# About

<p>
    I am a PhD candidate in Data Science at HEC Montréal (Decision Sciences), 
    specializing in statistical modeling and machine learning for complex, 
    high-dimensional systems.
</p>

<p>
    My research focuses on Bayesian inference and hierarchical modeling, 
    with particular emphasis on skewed and heavy-tailed distributions in 
    spatio-temporal settings. I am particularly interested in market 
    microstructure, high-frequency trading, execution modeling, and 
    financial pricing.
</p>

I build research-driven trading systems with an emphasis on **market microstructure**, **execution quality**, and **risk-aware automation**.

**Interests**
- Systematic trading & execution
- Market-making dynamics and adverse selection
- Backtesting realism: slippage, fees, latency, partial fills
- Robust engineering: state machines, logging, monitoring

**Currently targeting**
- Quant Research / Quant Trading roles
- Execution, market microstructure, and systematic strategies
