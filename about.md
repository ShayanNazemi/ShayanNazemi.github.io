# About

I build research-driven trading systems with an emphasis on **market microstructure**, **execution quality**, and **risk-aware automation**.

**Interests**
- Systematic trading & execution
- Market-making dynamics and adverse selection
- Backtesting realism: slippage, fees, latency, partial fills
- Robust engineering: state machines, logging, monitoring

**Currently targeting**
- Quant Research / Quant Trading roles
- Execution, market microstructure, and systematic strategies
